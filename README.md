# EasyRental

This is a MySQL project that helps make car rental services easier. This system is made to help a transportation & rental businesses keep track of vehicles as well as customer information. There’s been a spike in the need for car rentals and this database will help companies keep track of the influx of data. The company will use this database to keep data in an organized manner. The customers who are burrowing the vehicles will provide the following: license number, name, payment info, home address, and the vehicle type / vehicle brand preference. The system will cross-check to see if the customer’s desired vehicle is available or not. To do so, the system will  perform a check on the database. If the car is not taken the customer will be permitted to borrow the vehicle. This database will be beneficial to both the customer and the company.
