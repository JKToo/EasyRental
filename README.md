# EasyRental

This is a MySQL project that helps make rental service easier. The system is made to help a transportation/rental business keep track of vehicles and information on the customers who borrowed them. There’s been a spike of needing car rentals and this database will help companies keep track of the influx of data.The company will use this database to keep track of what vehicles were lended and who they were lended to. The customer/user who is burrowing the vehicles will provide their license number, name, payment info, home address, the vehicle type / vehicle brand preference. The system will check to see if the customer’s desired vehicle is available or not. It will do this by checking the database. If the car is not taken he will be permitted to borrow the vehicle. This database will benefit both the customer and the company. The customer will know which vehicle is available and the company will be well organized.
